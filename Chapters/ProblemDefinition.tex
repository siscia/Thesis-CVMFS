The goal of this work is to describe a suitable structure of a read only filesystem to host containers images.

The result of this work has been applied at CERN to distribute containers images in a global read-only filesystem, CVMFS.

In the context of CVMFS we aim at:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimize the amount of space required
\item Minimize the start up time of containers
\item Limit the number of files in the CVMFS catalogs 
\item Minimize the complexity of managing the filesystem itself
\end{itemize}
