  abstract={Containerization technology is becoming more and more popular because it provides an efficient way to improve deployment flexibility by packaging up code into software micro-environments. Yet, containerization has limitations and one of the main ones is the fact that entire container images need to be transferred before they can be used. Container images can be seen as software stacks and High Energy Physics has long solved the distribution problem for large software stacks with CernVM-FS. CernVM-FS provides a global, shared software area, where clients only load the small subset of binaries that are accessed for any given compute job. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of efficient image distribution using CernVM-FS for storage and transport of container images. We chose to implement our solution for the Docker platform, due to its popularity and widespread use. To minimize the impact on existing workflows our implementation comes as a Docker plugin, meaning that users will continue to pull, run, modify, and store Docker images using standard Docker tools. We introduce the concept of a thin image, whose contents are served on demand from CernVM-FS repositories. Such behavior closely reassembles the lazy evaluation strategy in programming language theory. Our measurements confirm that the time before a task starts executing depends only on the size of the files actually used, minimizing the cold start-up time in all cases.}

abstract={Delivering complex software across a worldwide distributed system is a major challenge in high-throughput scientific computing. The problem arises at different scales for many scientific communities that use grids, clouds, and distributed clusters to satisfy their computing needs. For high-energy physics (HEP) collaborations dealing with large amounts of data that rely on hundreds of thousands of cores spread around the world for data processing, the challenge is particularly acute. To serve the needs of the HEP community, several iterations were made to create a scalable, user-level filesystem that delivers software worldwide on a daily basis. The implementation was designed in 2006 to serve the needs of one experiment running on thousands of machines. Since that time, this idea evolved into a new production global-scale filesystem serving the needs of multiple science communities on hundreds of thousands of machines around the world.},

abstract={Docker has been widely adopted in enterprise-level container environment. As an important part of Docker-based container ecosystem, Docker Registry provides the service of storing, distributing and managing Docker images, which is crucial to run Docker containers. In large-scale container platforms, deploying applications is prone to overburdening Docker Registry with flooding network traffic, and this situation may even cause failures of image services. In this paper, we present a new P2P-based large-scale image distribution system called FID (Faster Image Distribution), which is able to accelerate the speed of distributing Docker images by taking full advantage of the bandwidth of not only Docker Registry but also other nodes in the cluster. We implemented and validated FID on the enterprise-level cluster. The experiment results show that, compared to the native image distribution method, FID reduces at least 97% of network traffic for Docker Registry. Furthermore, it reduces 83.50% of distribution time on average when distributing images among 200 nodes, and particularly, reduces up to 91.35% of distribution time for the 500M image of Hadoop.},
